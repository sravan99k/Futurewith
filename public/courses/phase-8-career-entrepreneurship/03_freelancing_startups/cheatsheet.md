## Freelancing Quick Start

### Service Pricing Calculator

**Hourly Rate Formula:**
```
Target Annual Income ÷ (Weeks × Hours/Week) × Risk Factor = Hourly Rate

Example: $120,000 ÷ (48 × 30) × 1.25 = $104/hour
```

**Project Pricing Formula:**
```
(Hours × Hourly Rate) × Complexity Factor × Urgency Factor = Project Price

Complexity Factors:
- Simple (1.0): Well-defined scope, familiar technology
- Moderate (1.25): Some unknowns, standard integration
- Complex (1.5): Significant unknowns, custom development
- Highly Complex (2.0+): R&D, cutting-edge AI, enterprise scale

Urgency Factors:
- Standard timeline (1.0)
- Accelerated (1.25-1.5)
- Rush (1.5-2.0)
```

**Monthly Retainer Formula:**
```
Base Hours × Hourly Rate × Value Multiplier = Retainer Price

Value Multiplier: 1.1-1.5x (depending on strategic value)
```

### Service Package Examples

| Package | Hours/Month | Deliverables | Price Range |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Starter | 10-20 | Basic ML models, monthly reports | $2,000-5,000 |
| Growth | 40-60 | Custom solutions, optimization | $5,000-12,000 |
