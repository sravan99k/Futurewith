## Pricing Calculator & Formulas

### Basic Pricing Formulas

#### Hourly Rate Calculator

```
Annual Income Goal ÷ Available Hours = Base Hourly Rate
Base Hourly Rate × 1.5 (overhead) = Minimum Hourly Rate
Minimum Hourly Rate × 1.5 (profit) = Target Hourly Rate
```

**Example:**

- Income Goal: $100,000/year
- Available Hours: 1,200 hours/year (24 hours/week)
- Base Rate: $100,000 ÷ 1,200 = $83.33/hour
- Minimum Rate: $83.33 × 1.5 = $125/hour
- Target Rate: $125 × 1.5 = $187.50/hour

#### Project-Based Pricing

```
Time Estimate (hours) × Hourly Rate = Base Price
Base Price × 1.3 (risk premium) = Project Price
```

#### Value-Based Pricing

```
Client Value Created × Appropriate Percentage = Value-Based Price
```

### Pricing by Service Type

| Service Type        | Typical Pricing Model | Rate Range          |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Consulting**      | Hourly or Daily       | $75-300/hour        |
| **Project Work**    | Fixed Project Fee     | 1.5-3x hourly rate  |
| **Creative Work**   | Per Asset or Project  | $50-500 per asset   |
| **Technical Work**  | Hourly or Project     | $80-200/hour        |
| **Writing/Content** | Per Word or Project   | $0.25-2.00 per word |
| **Design Work**     | Per Project or Hourly | $50-150/hour        |

### Pricing Strategy Formulas

#### Break-Even Analysis

```
Fixed Costs ÷ Gross Margin % = Break-Even Revenue
```

#### Profit Margin Calculation

```
(Revenue - Costs) ÷ Revenue × 100 = Profit Margin %
```

#### Client Lifetime Value

```
Average Project Value × Number of Projects per Year × Years Retained = LTV
```

### Pricing Psychology Tips

1. **Price Anchoring**
   - Present higher option first
   - Use three pricing tiers
   - Highlight recommended option

2. **Value Communication**
   - Lead with benefits, not features
   - Quantify value when possible
   - Use comparisons to higher-cost alternatives

3. **Payment Terms Impact**
   - Net 30: Standard payment terms
   - Net 15: 2% discount for early payment
   - Net 7: 5% discount for immediate payment
   - 50/50 split: 50% upfront, 50% on completion
