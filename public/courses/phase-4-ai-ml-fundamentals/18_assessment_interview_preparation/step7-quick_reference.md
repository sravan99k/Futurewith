- **Best for**: Small to medium datasets (100-10,000 examples)
- **Pros**:
  - ✅ Fast to train (minutes to hours)
  - ✅ Works well with small data
  - ✅ Easy to understand and explain
  - ✅ No special hardware needed
- **Cons**:
  - ❌ Requires manual feature engineering
  - ❌ May plateau on very large datasets

#### **Deep Learning** 🧠

- **Like**: A massive automated factory
- **Best for**: Large datasets (10,000+ examples)
- **Pros**:
  - ✅ Automatically finds patterns
  - ✅ Excellent on very large datasets
  - ✅ State-of-the-art results
- **Cons**:
  - ❌ Needs lots of data and computing power
  - ❌ Hard to understand why it makes decisions
  - ❌ Takes a long time to train

### 🎯 Quick Decision Guide - What Should I Use?

#### **If you're just starting out...**

1. **Try Traditional ML first** - Random Forest or Gradient Boosting
2. **Simple problems** → Linear/Logistic Regression
3. **Complex patterns** → Random Forest
4. **Maximum accuracy** → Gradient Boosting

#### **For specific problems:**

- **📊 Predicting numbers (prices, scores)** → Start with Linear Regression
- **🎯 Yes/No questions (spam/not spam)** → Start with Logistic Regression
- **🖼️ Image recognition** → Use CNN (Deep Learning)
- **📝 Text analysis** → Start with traditional ML, upgrade to BERT for better results
- **👥 Grouping customers** → K-Means clustering
- **🔍 Finding unusual transactions** → Isolation Forest

#### **When to upgrade to Deep Learning:**

- You have 10,000+ examples
- Traditional ML isn't accurate enough
- You have a GPU and time to experiment
- Working with images, audio, or complex text

## 💻 Code Templates Library - Ready-to-Use Examples

### 🚀 Step-by-Step: Your First AI Project

#### **Template 1: Basic AI Pipeline (Like Following a Recipe)**

**What this does**: Takes your data and trains an AI to make predictions
**When to use**: For any prediction problem (prices, categories, etc.)

```python
# Step 1: Get your tools ready (like gathering ingredients)
import pandas as pd              # For working with data
import numpy as np               # For math calculations
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  # For splitting data
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder  # For cleaning data
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier  # Your AI model

# Step 2: Load your data (like getting your ingredients)
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')  # Load your data file
print("Data shape:", df.shape)     # Show how much data you have
print(df.head())                   # Look at first few rows

# Step 3: Separate what you want to predict from everything else
X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1)  # Everything except the answer
y = df['target_column']               # What you want to predict

# Step 4: Clean up missing information (like removing bad ingredients)
# For numbers: fill with average
X = X.fillna(X.mean())
# For text: fill with most common
X = X.fillna(X.mode().iloc[0])

# Step 5: Convert text to numbers (AI likes numbers)
le = LabelEncoder()
categorical_cols = X.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
for col in categorical_cols:
    X[col] = le.fit_transform(X[col])

# Step 6: Split data for training and testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# Step 7: Train your AI (like cooking your meal)
model = RandomForestClassifier()  # Create your AI
model.fit(X_train, y_train)       # Train it with your data

# Step 8: Test how good your AI is
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Your AI is {accuracy:.1%} accurate!")

# Step 9: Make predictions on new data
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

**💡 What each step means:**

- **Step 1**: Get the necessary tools (libraries)
- **Step 2**: Load your data from a file
- **Step 3**: Separate the question from the answers
- **Step 4**: Handle missing or incomplete data
- **Step 5**: Convert text to numbers (AI speaks numbers)
- **Step 6**: Split data for training and testing
- **Step 7**: Train the AI model
- **Step 8**: Check how accurate your AI is
- **Step 9**: Use your AI to make new predictions

#### **Template 2: Quick Classification (For Yes/No or Categories)**

**What this does**: Sorts things into groups (like spam/not spam)
**When to use**: Email filtering, image classification, customer types

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Create and train the classifier
classifier = LogisticRegression()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

# See detailed results
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# See confusion matrix (what did it get right/wrong?)
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
```

#### **Template 3: Regression (For Predicting Numbers)**

**What this does**: Predicts continuous values (like prices, temperatures)
**When to use**: House prices, stock prices, exam scores

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Create and train the regressor
regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)

# Calculate error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}")
print(f"R² Score: {r2:.3f} (closer to 1.0 is better)")
```

# Scale features

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

````

        if self.transform:
            image = self.transform(image)

        return image, label
````

#### Text Data Pipeline

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

# Text preprocessing
def preprocess_text(text):

    tokens = word_tokenize(text)

    # Remove stopwords and stem
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    stemmer = PorterStemmer()

    tokens = [stemmer.stem(token) for token in tokens
              if token not in stop_words and token.isalpha()]

    return ' '.join(tokens)

# Using pre-trained tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

def tokenize_texts(texts, max_length=512):
    return tokenizer(
        texts,
        padding=True,
        truncation=True,
        max_length=max_length,
        return_tensors='pt'
    )

import numpy as np
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer, KNNImputer

# Check missing values
missing_info = df.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values per column:")
print(missing_info[missing_info > 0])

# Remove rows with missing values
df_clean = df.dropna()

# Fill with mean/median/mode
df['column'] = df['column'].fillna(df['column'].median())

# Advanced imputation
imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=5)
df_imputed = pd.DataFrame(imputer.fit_transform(df), columns=df.columns)
```

plt.show()

# Z-score method
z_scores = np.abs(stats.zscore(df['column']))
outliers = df[z_scores > 3]
print(f"Number of outliers: {len(outliers)}")

# IQR method
Q1 = df['column'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['column'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
outliers = df[(df['column'] < lower_bound) | (df['column'] > upper_bound)]

# Remove outliers
df_clean = df[(df['column'] >= lower_bound) & (df['column'] <= upper_bound)]

# Cap outliers
df['column'] = df['column'].clip(lower=lower_bound, upper=upper_bound)
```

from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# Load image
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Resize
resized = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))

# Normalize (for neural networks)
