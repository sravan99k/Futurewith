3. Timeline/deadline
4. Next steps/expected outcome

Example:
"[ACTION NEEDED] Code Review - User Auth Module

Context: The user authentication module is ready for review before we deploy to staging tomorrow.

Request: Please review the pull request #234 focusing on security implementation and error handling.

Timeline: Need approval by EOD today for tomorrow's deployment.

Next steps: I'll address any feedback by 6 PM and merge if approved."
