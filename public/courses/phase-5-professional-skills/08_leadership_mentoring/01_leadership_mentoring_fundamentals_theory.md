## _"A leader is best when people barely know they exist. When their work is done, their aim fulfilled, people will say: we did it ourselves."_ - Lao Tzu, adapted for modern leadership

## 🔄 Common Confusions

1. **"Leadership is only about having authority and making decisions"**
   **Explanation:** Modern leadership is about influence, empowerment, and enabling others to succeed. True leaders create environments where teams can excel without constant direction from the top.
