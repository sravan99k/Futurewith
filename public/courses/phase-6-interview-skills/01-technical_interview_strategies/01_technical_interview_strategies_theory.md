2. Discuss multiple approaches
3. Choose optimal solution with reasoning
4. Implement and explain

Example:
"Let me clarify - are we looking for the second unique value or just
the second largest? Assuming second unique, I can think of a few approaches:
sorting (O(n log n)), using a heap (O(n log k)), or single pass tracking
(O(n)). The single pass approach is optimal..."

**Experience-Based Questions:**
"Tell me about a challenging technical problem you solved."

Response Strategy:

1. Set context and problem scope

By preparing thoroughly, communicating clearly, thinking systematically, and maintaining a growth-oriented perspective, you can demonstrate both your current capabilities and your potential for continued learning and contribution.

Remember that technical interviews are not just about finding the perfect answer, but about showing how you think, learn, adapt, and collaborate on complex technical challenges. The best technical interviews feel like productive working sessions with future colleagues exploring interesting problems together.---

## 🔄 Common Confusions

### Confusion 1: Coding During System Design Interviews

**The Confusion:** Many candidates focus too much on writing actual code during system design interviews when interviewers want to see thinking process, trade-offs, and architectural decisions.
**The Clarity:** System design interviews are about high-level architecture, scalability, and decision-making. You can use pseudocode or high-level language, but the focus should be on problem-solving approach, component interactions, and explaining your choices.
**Why It Matters:** Interviewers want to see your ability to think like an architect, not a programmer. Over-focusing on syntax details shows you don't understand the interview's real purpose.

### Confusion 2: "I Don't Know" in Technical Interviews

**The Confusion:** Candidates think saying "I don't know" is a career-killer, so they either guess randomly or try to guess-pieces and stall.
**The Clarity:** Admitting uncertainty honestly and showing how you would find the answer (research methods, hypothetical approaches, what questions you'd ask) is much more valuable than fake confidence.
**Why It Matters:** Real work often involves learning new things. Interviewers want to see you can learn effectively and think through problems systematically.

### Confusion 3: Over-Engineering Solutions

**The Confusion:** Some candidates try to build the most complex, "best" solution they can think of, using advanced algorithms or technologies even when not needed.
**The Clarity:** Start with the simplest working solution, then discuss potential improvements if time allows. Show you can judge complexity appropriateness.
**Why It Matters:** In real work, you need to balance perfection with practicality. Over-engineering wastes time and resources and shows poor judgment.

### Confusion 4: Not Explaining Your Thought Process

**The Confusion:** Candidates think they should just start coding and show their skills silently, then present the final solution.
**The Clarity:** Think out loud! Explain your approach, what patterns you recognize, why you're choosing specific strategies. This helps the interviewer follow your thinking.
**Why It Matters:** Communication skills are as important as technical skills. Interviewers need to see how you approach problems and can explain technical concepts.

### Confusion 5: Ignoring Time Management

**The Confusion:** Spending too much time on optimization or edge cases before getting a working solution.
**The Clarity:** Get a working, correct solution first. Then optimize. If time is short, a simple working solution is better than a complex incomplete one.
**Why It Matters:** Time management shows good engineering judgment. You need to balance perfection with delivery timelines.

### Confusion 6: Not Using Available Resources

**The Confusion:** Some candidates feel they can't use any external resources, so they struggle to remember API details or library functions.
**The Clarity:** You can use documentation, Google search (in some formats), and reference materials. Show how you find and use information effectively.
**Why It Matters:** Real developers use documentation, search, and external resources constantly. Knowing how to find information is a key skill.

### Confusion 7: Behavioral Questions as Mini-Breaks

**The Confusion:** Treating behavioral questions as filler questions that don't require preparation or affect the interview outcome.
**The Clarity:** Behavioral questions often determine cultural fit, leadership potential, and soft skills. They require specific preparation using techniques like STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
**Why It Matters:** Technical skills get you the interview; behavioral skills get you the job. Many candidates fail here despite strong technical performance.

### Confusion 8: Interview Practice vs. Real Learning

**The Confusion:** Focusing only on interview-specific questions without building actual depth of knowledge and experience.
**TheThe Clarity:** The best interview preparation combines interview practice with genuine skill building. Build real projects, contribute to open source, and deepen your understanding.
**Why It Matters:** Shallow knowledge will fail you in technical discussions. Real experience shows through in problem-solving approaches and deeper insights.
