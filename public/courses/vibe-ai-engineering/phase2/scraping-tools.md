# AI Scraping Tools: The Industrial Arsenal

Mastering the toolset to extract data without writing complex, brittle scripts.

## 1. Industrial Role: Research Engineer
Setting up the automated pipes that feed data into your AI application.

## 2. Requirements (Inputs)
- **Target selectors**: CSS classes or Xpath from your target sites.
- **API Keys**: Firecrawl or Jina account keys.

## 3. The Industrial Stack
- **Firecrawl**: The gold standard for LLM-ready markdown. Perfect for complex sites.
- **Jina Reader**: `r.jina.ai/[URL]` - The simplest way to turn any URL into text.
- **Bright Data**: For enterprise-grade scraping and proxy rotation.

## 4. The Industrial Task
- Setup a Firecrawl workflow to crawl an entire domain and convert it to Markdown.
- Test Jina Reader for quick, no-auth extraction of individual articles.

## 5. Exercise: The Scrape Test
Pick a news site (e.g., TechCrunch). Try to scrape the front page using Jina Reader (prepend `r.jina.ai/` to the URL). Inspect the result—is the data clean?
