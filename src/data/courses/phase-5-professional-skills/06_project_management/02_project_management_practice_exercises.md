Pre-Mortem Template:
Failure Scenario: "Project was delivered 6 months late"
Possible Causes:
- Underestimated development complexity
- Key team members left during project
- Requirements kept changing
- Integration took longer than expected
Prevention Strategies: [List specific actions]
Early Warning Signs: [List observable indicators]

```

### Week 3: Mitigation Strategies and Implementation

#### Risk Response Strategies

**Strategy 1: Risk Avoidance**

```
Example: Avoiding cutting-edge, unproven technology
Implementation:
- Use mature, well-supported technologies
- Choose vendors with proven track records
- Avoid experimental approaches in critical paths
- Stick to well-known architectural patterns

Practice Scenario:
Risk: New JavaScript framework may have unknown issues
Avoidance Strategy: Use established React instead of experimental framework
Trade-offs: May miss performance benefits, but reduces learning curve and bugs
```

**Strategy 2: Risk Mitigation**

```
Example: Reducing probability or impact of identified risks
Implementation:
- Implement backup systems
- Cross-train team members
- Add buffer time to schedules
- Create redundant solutions

Practice Scenario:
Risk: Key developer leaving during critical project phase
Mitigation Strategies:
- Pair programming for knowledge transfer
- Documentation of critical design decisions
- Cross-training other developers on key components
- Retention bonuses or incentives
```

**Strategy 3: Risk Transfer**

```
Example: Shifting risk to third parties through contracts or insurance
Implementation:
- Vendor SLA agreements with penalties
- Professional liability insurance
- Fixed-price contracts with suppliers
- Cloud service provider guarantees

Practice Scenario:
Risk: Infrastructure failures causing downtime
Transfer Strategies:
- Cloud provider SLA with uptime guarantees
- Cyber insurance for security breaches
- Vendor penalties for service disruptions
- Third-party monitoring services with guarantees
```

**Strategy 4: Risk Acceptance**

```
Example: Acknowledging risk but taking no proactive action
Implementation:
- Ensure stakeholders understand and accept risk
- Create contingency budgets for accepted risks
- Monitor risk triggers closely
- Have response plans ready if risk materializes

Practice Scenario:
Risk: Minor performance degradation under extreme load
Acceptance Rationale:
- Extreme load scenarios are rare
- Cost of prevention exceeds potential impact
- Customer base unlikely to reach those levels
- Can be addressed post-launch if needed
```

#### Contingency Planning Practice

**Contingency Plan Template**:

```
Risk Event: Critical team member sudden departure
Trigger Conditions:
- Team member gives notice
- Team member becomes unavailable due to illness/emergency
- Performance issues requiring team member change

Immediate Response (0-24 hours):
1. Assess impact on current sprint and project timeline
2. Identify critical knowledge and work in progress
3. Reassign immediate responsibilities
4. Communicate with stakeholders about potential impacts

Short-term Actions (1-7 days):
1. Begin knowledge transfer from remaining team
2. Review all documentation and code comments
3. Identify external expertise needed
4. Adjust project timeline and scope if necessary

Long-term Actions (1-4 weeks):
1. Recruit replacement team member
2. Implement improved knowledge sharing practices
3. Update project documentation
4. Conduct lessons learned session
```

### Advanced Risk Management Techniques

#### Monte Carlo Simulation for Schedule Risk

**Practice Exercise**:

```
Scenario: Estimating project completion date with uncertainty
Variables:
- Feature A: 5-15 days (triangular distribution: min=5, mode=8, max=15)
- Feature B: 3-10 days (triangular distribution: min=3, mode=6, max=10)
- Integration: 2-8 days (triangular distribution: min=2, mode=4, max=8)
- Testing: 5-12 days (triangular distribution: min=5, mode=7, max=12)

Simulation Results:
- 50% confidence: 21 days
- 80% confidence: 28 days
- 95% confidence: 35 days

Use results to:
- Set realistic expectations with stakeholders
- Plan resource allocation
- Determine appropriate buffers
```

#### Risk-Adjusted Decision Making

**Decision Framework Practice**:

```
Decision: Choose between two architectural approaches
Option A (Microservices):
- Expected benefit: High scalability
- Implementation effort: High
- Risk: Complex deployment and debugging
- Risk-adjusted value: High benefit × 0.7 (risk factor) = Medium

Option B (Monolithic):
- Expected benefit: Faster initial development
- Implementation effort: Medium
- Risk: Scaling challenges later
- Risk-adjusted value: Medium benefit × 0.9 (risk factor) = Medium

Decision Process:
1. Identify all viable options
2. Estimate benefits and efforts
3. Assess risks and create adjustment factors
4. Calculate risk-adjusted values
5. Consider stakeholder risk tolerance
6. Make informed decision with clear rationale
```

### Risk Communication and Reporting

#### Stakeholder Risk Communication

**Risk Dashboard Creation**:

```
Executive Summary:
- Overall project risk level: MEDIUM
- Number of high-priority risks: 2
- Trend: IMPROVING (was HIGH last week)
- Key concerns: API vendor stability, resource availability

High-Priority Risks:
Risk 1: Third-party API failure
- Impact: Could delay launch by 2 weeks
- Probability: Medium
- Mitigation: Backup service being implemented
- Status: In progress

Risk 2: Key developer availability
- Impact: Could slow development by 30%
- Probability: Low
- Mitigation: Knowledge transfer completed
- Status: Monitored
```

1. **Risk Register Review** (15 minutes)
   - New risks identified
   - Risk status updates
   - Closed/resolved risks
