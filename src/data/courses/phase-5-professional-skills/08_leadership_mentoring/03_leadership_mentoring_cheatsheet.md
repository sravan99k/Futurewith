### Mentoring Process and Structure

```
Initial Setup (First Meeting):
1. Establish rapport and trust
2. Understand mentee's goals and challenges
3. Set expectations and boundaries
4. Define success metrics
5. Schedule regular check-ins

Goal Setting Framework:
SMART Goals:
- Specific: "Improve React skills"
- Measurable: "Complete 3 React projects"
- Achievable: "With 2 hours/week practice"
- Relevant: "To advance to senior developer"
- Time-bound: "Within 6 months"

Development Planning:
Short-term (1-3 months):
- Immediate skill gaps
- Current project improvements
- Quick wins and confidence building

Medium-term (3-6 months):
- Broader skill development
- Leadership opportunities
- Cross-team collaboration

Long-term (6-12 months):
- Career advancement
- Specialization areas
- Industry recognition

Regular Check-ins Structure:
1. Progress review (what's working/not working)
2. Challenge discussion (current obstacles)
3. Learning opportunities (new projects, training)
4. Goal adjustment (if needed)
5. Next steps planning
```

### Effective Mentoring Techniques

```
The GROW Model:
Goal: What does the mentee want to achieve?
Reality: What is the current situation?
Options: What could they do?
Will: What will they do?

Example:
Goal: "I want to become a tech lead"
Reality: "I'm a senior developer with strong technical skills but no leadership experience"
Options: "Lead a small project, mentor junior developers, present at team meetings"
Will: "I'll volunteer to lead the authentication project and mentor the new intern"

Active Listening Techniques:
- Summarizing: "So you're saying..."
- Clarifying: "Help me understand..."
- Emotional labeling: "It sounds like you're frustrated..."
- Silence: Allow processing time

Questioning Strategies:
Open-ended questions:
- "What approaches have you considered?"
- "How do you think others perceive this?"
- "What would success look like?"

Hypothetical questions:
- "What if budget wasn't a constraint?"
- "How would you explain this to a new team member?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"

Scaling questions:
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you?"
- "What would make it a 7 instead of a 5?"

Socratic Method:
Guide mentees to discover answers themselves through questioning:
"What do you think causes this issue?"
"What evidence do you have?"
"What are the implications?"
"What alternatives exist?"
```

### Giving Effective Feedback

```
SBI Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact):
Situation: Describe when and where
Behavior: Describe what you observed
Impact: Explain the effect

Example:
"In yesterday's code review (Situation), you interrupted Sarah three times while she was explaining her approach (Behavior). This seemed to make her lose confidence and she stopped contributing to the discussion (Impact)."

Feedback Best Practices:
✓ Be specific and timely
✓ Focus on behavior, not personality
✓ Balance positive and constructive feedback
✓ Make it actionable
✓ Follow up on progress

Growth Mindset Language:
❌ "You're not good at presentations"
✅ "Your presentation skills can be developed with practice"

❌ "You always interrupt people"
✅ "I've noticed you sometimes interrupt others. Let's work on active listening techniques"

❌ "You're too junior for this"
✅ "This is a stretch assignment. Let's identify what support you need to succeed"

Feedback Timing:
- Immediate: For safety or critical issues
- Planned: For development conversations
- Regular: During 1:1 meetings
- Ongoing: As part of daily interactions
```
