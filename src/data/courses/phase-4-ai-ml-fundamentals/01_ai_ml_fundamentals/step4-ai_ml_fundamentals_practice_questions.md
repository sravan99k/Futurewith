### **Question 12: Prediction Practice**

A house price prediction model uses these rules:

- Houses with 3+ bedrooms and 200+ sqft = Expensive
- Houses with 1-2 bedrooms and 100-199 sqft = Affordable
- Houses with 2 bedrooms and 100-199 sqft = Mid-range

Predict the price category for these houses:

| House | Bedrooms | Square Feet | Prediction   |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| A     | 4        | 250         | ****\_\_**** |
| B     | 1        | 80          | ****\_\_**** |

## 🎯 **SECTION F: FUN CHALLENGES** (For All Levels)

### **Challenge 1: AI Detective**

Look at this conversation between two AI systems:

**System A:** "I found 5 patterns in the shopping data"
**System B:** "I found 1000 patterns - I'm much better!"
**System A:** "But I found the most important patterns - the ones that predict customer behavior"

**Questions:**

1. Which system would you trust more and why?
2. What does this tell you about AI?

**Discussion Points:**

- More patterns doesn't always mean better AI
- Important patterns matter more than many patterns
- Understanding what matters is key

---

### **Challenge 2: Build Your Own Rules**

Create a simple AI rule system for this scenario:

**Scenario:** A simple chatbot that helps people choose what to wear based on weather.

**Your Rules:**

2. If temperature < 10°C, recommend: ******\_\_\_******
3. If it's raining, recommend: ******\_\_\_******
4. If it's sunny, recommend: ******\_\_\_******

**Sample Answers:**

1. Light clothes, shorts, t-shirts
2. Warm clothes, jackets, boots
3. Raincoat, umbrella, waterproof shoes
4. Sunglasses, light layers

### **Challenge 3: AI Storytelling**

Complete this story about an AI learning to recognize fruit:

"Once upon a time, there was an AI named 'Berry' who had never seen fruit before. On Monday, Berry's human showed it an apple and said 'This is an apple - it's red, round, and sweet.' On Tuesday, the human showed Berry an orange and said 'This is an orange - it's orange, round, and citrus.' After seeing many fruits, Berry learned to recognize apples by their ****\_\_\_\_**** and oranges by their ****\_\_\_\_****. When Berry met a new fruit that was red and round but smelled like citrus, it would probably say ****\_\_\_\_**** because ****\_\_\_\_****."

**Answers:** color/shape, color/smell, "I need more information", it has mixed characteristics

## 🎯 **SECTION G: ANSWER KEY & EXPLANATIONS**

### **Understanding Your Mistakes:**

**If you got Question 2 wrong:**

- AI can work with many types of data: text, images, sound, numbers
- Python is a programming language, not AI itself

**If you got Question 5 wrong:**

- Supervised Learning = Teacher with answers (spam detection, face recognition)
- Unsupervised Learning = Finding patterns yourself (grouping customers)
- Reinforcement Learning = Learning by rewards (game playing)

**If you got Question 13 wrong:**

- AI needs good quality training data
- Using same data for training and testing is like giving students the exact exam for practice
- Models can be too simple or too complex
