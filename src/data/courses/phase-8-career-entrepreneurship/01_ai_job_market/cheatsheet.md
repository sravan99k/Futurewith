## Quick Formulas to Know

### Model Evaluation
```
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1 = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)
AUC = Area Under ROC Curve

Gradient Descent:
w = w - learning_rate * gradient
```

### Statistics
```
Mean = Σx / n
Variance = Σ(x - mean)² / n
Standard Deviation = √variance
Correlation = Covariance(x,y) / (σx * σy)
```
