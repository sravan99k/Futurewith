# Prompt Engineering Foundations: Software for LLMs

In Phase 1, the **Product Manager** translates the vision into instructions. You are writing the "logic gates" using natural language.

## 1. Industrial Role: Product Manager (Visionary)
Your job is to translate the user’s pain into an AI instruction set. You aren't "chatting" with an AI; you are **writing software requirements** that an LLM can parse.

## 2. Requirements (Inputs)
- **Vision Statement**: The core goal from Phase 1.1.
- **Logical Constraints**: What the AI must *never* do (guardrails).

## 3. The Industrial Stack
- **Core Tech**: Markdown Specifications, Structured Text.
- **AI Tools**: **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (The gold standard for logic), **ChatGPT**.

## 4. The Industrial Task
- Master the **CO-STAR** framework (Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response).
- Define the **System Aura** (The persona and behavioral constraints).

## 5. Framework Spotlight: CO-STAR
- **Context**: Provide background on the task.
- **Objective**: Define the exact goal.
- **Style**: Specify the writing style.
- **Tone**: Set the attitude.
- **Audience**: Identify who the output is for.
- **Response**: Define the format (JSON, Markdown, etc.).

## Exercise: The System Aura
Write a 5stence "System Aura" for a Legal Research Agent. Use Markdown to bold its primary constraints.
