# Problem Definition: The Product Manager's Lens

In an industrial pipeline, the first phase isn't about code—it's about **Product Management**. If you solve the wrong problem, the best AI in the world won't save you.

## 1. Industrial Role: Product Manager
As the **Product Manager** in Phase 1, your goal is to map the market gap. You aren't thinking about "how to build" yet; you are thinking about "why it should exist."

### Your Key Responsibilities:
- **Pain Point Mapping**: Identifying where time or money is being leaked.
- **Scope Control**: Ensuring the project doesn't try to "solve everything" at once.
- **ROI Estimation**: Predicting if the AI logic will actually pay for itself.

## 2. Requirements (Inputs)
- **Pain Point Map**: A list of at least 3 specific inefficiencies.
- **User Persona**: A clear description of *who* is suffering from this problem.

## 3. The Industrial Stack
- **Core Tech**: Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), User Flow Maps.
- **AI Tools**: **Perplexity** (for market research), **ChatGPT/Claude** (for brainstorming).

## 4. The Industrial Task
- Map out the exact manual steps of a problem.
- Define a "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) that automates at least 50% of the pain.

## 5. Exercise: Spot the Inefficiency
Use an AI tool (Perplexity) to identify 3 industries that still use manual PDF processing. Document the estimated "Hours Lost" per week in these roles. This is your industrial foundation for Phase 2.
