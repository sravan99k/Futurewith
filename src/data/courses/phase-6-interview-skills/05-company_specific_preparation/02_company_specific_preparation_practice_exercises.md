## Common Confusions

### 1. Research vs. Preparation Balance
**Confusion**: Spending too much time researching vs. practicing interview skills.
**Resolution**: Allocate 40% time to research, 60% to interview practice. Set specific research goals (company values, recent products, technical stack) and stick to them. Create research templates to standardize information gathering.

### 2. Company-Specific vs. Generic Preparation
**Confusion**: How much to customize vs. building fundamental interview skills.
**Resolution**: Master core skills first, then add company-specific layers. Generic preparation (problem-solving, system design, communication) applies to all companies. Company-specific prep (culture, products, technical approaches) adds personalization.

### 3. Multiple Company Preparation Strategy
**Confusion**: How to prepare for multiple companies simultaneously without diluting efforts.
**Resolution**: Create a master preparation plan with shared core elements, then maintain separate company-specific notebooks. Practice with questions from all target companies but focus deep-dives on current application priorities.

### 4. Information Source Reliability
**Confusion**: Which sources to trust for company information (recent news, employee experiences, interview reports).
**Resolution**: Prioritize official sources first (company blog, recent earnings calls, product launches), then verified employee testimonials (LinkedIn, Glassdoor with grain of salt), then interview experiences from trusted platforms (Blind, LeetCode company pages).

### 5. Cultural Fit Assessment
**Confusion**: How to research and demonstrate cultural fit without being inauthentic.
**Resolution**: Identify 2-3 core values that genuinely resonate with you. Use STAR method to prepare examples from your experience that demonstrate these values in action. Focus on showing authentic alignment rather than trying to fit a specific mold.

### 6. Technical Stack Research Depth
**Confusion**: How deeply to research a company's technology stack for interviews.
**Resolution**: Focus on understanding their primary tech stack, recent technology choices, and technical challenges they discuss publicly. Don't try to master their entire infrastructure, but understand their core technology decisions and trade-offs.

### 7. Recent Events and News Preparation
**Confusion**: How to incorporate recent company news without appearing rehearsed or opportunistic.
**Resolution**: Follow 2-3 key company developments naturally. When discussing them, focus on technical or product implications rather than just business outcomes. Ask thoughtful questions showing genuine interest rather than reciting news.

### 8. Networking vs. Direct Application Strategy
**Confusion**: Whether to network with employees before applying vs. applying directly.
**Resolution**: Do both, but with different timing and approaches. Start networking 2-3 months before application to build genuine relationships. Apply directly when ready, but leverage any connections you've built for insights and potentially referrals.
